==== DelveDeeper HexCambridge Huawei Challenge Submission ====

This is the solution we have provided for the Huawei Challenge at HexCambridge 2021. 

We have created a neural network to test against the CIFAR 100 dataset.

Execution
---------

To execute the file you need to insert the following in the command line:

python main.py

After the model has finished running, the outputs are:

-The accuracy of the model
-A ckpt file in the current directory where main is saved


Evaluation
----------

We were successful in making a neural network to classify the images accurately within the data set.
